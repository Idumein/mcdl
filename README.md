# Minecraft Game Files Downloader

With the help of this program, one is able to download all files required to play all versions of Minecraft: Java Editions available in the official launcher.

It was made for archivation purposes, or cases such if the official servers would get taken offline. This program alone doesn't let anyone play the game without buying it, it is simply an automated downloader of otherwise publicly available files. You still need a launcher to be able to play the game, therefore it doesn't enable any form of piracy.

## Usage

Just execute the program and the files will be downloaded in the current working directory. As of now, there aren"t any command line flags.

Files are downloaded in the same directory structure as they are hosted on Mojang's/Microsoft's official servers, to make it easier for one to set up a local mirror.

You should be only using the downloaded game files for yourself, redistribution might be against Mojang's/Microsoft's Terms of Service / End-User License Agreement. I do not take responsibility for what one does with this tool or the downloaded game files.
